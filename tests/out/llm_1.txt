CLAIM: The United States borders Canada to the south
VERDICT: SUPPORTED
CONFIDENCE: 0.75
EVIDENCE USED: [1]
SOURCES:
  [1] usa.txt — "The United States of America borders Canada to the north."
---
EXPLANATION:
The claim states that the United States borders Canada to the south. The verdict is SUPPORTED with a confidence of 0.75. The alignment quote from evidence [1] supports the claim, stating that the United States borders Canada to the north. However, the claim specifies the direction as south, which contradicts the evidence. Evidence [2] indicates that the United States borders Mexico to the south, but this does not address the Canada border. The other evidence [3] and [4] discuss Earth's orbit and is irrelevant to the claim. Since the aligned quote [1] directly contradicts the claim, the verdict's support is inconsistent with the evidence. Missing evidence that confirms the southern border with Canada would be needed to fully support the claim, but the provided data does not include such information.
